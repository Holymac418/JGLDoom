# JGLDoom: A LWJGL source port of Doom.

JGLDoom is a source port of Doom using the LightWeight Java Game Library.
It is Intended to be a learning experience, and not really anything mainstream-usable (unless people want it to be mainstream-usable). 

## Features so far:
- Basic Fly-cam
- Reads IWAD's (or PWAD's) header and directory, printing the wad type, lump names and other misc stuff to the console.

## Most Recent Release:
- No releases yet.

### For it to read the WAD, the WAD must be in the src/main/resources directory. I cannot supply them.
